## 📝 IMPORTANT: About Your Resume

I noticed you mentioned attaching your resume, but **I didn't receive it** with your message.

### What This Means:
The portfolio is **100% complete and functional**, but it currently contains **placeholder content** like:
- "Your Name"
- Sample companies and job titles
- Example projects
- Generic skill lists

### How to Add YOUR Information:

I've made it **super easy** for you with THREE options:

#### Option 1: Interactive Form (Easiest) ⭐
1. Run: `npm install && npm run dev`
2. Open: `http://localhost:3000/content-form.html`
3. Fill in your resume information
4. Click "Generate Code"
5. Copy into `data/portfolio-data.ts`
6. Done! ✅

#### Option 2: Edit Data File
1. Open: `data/portfolio-data.ts`
2. Follow the instructions in the file
3. Replace all placeholder text
4. Save and refresh

#### Option 3: Share Your Resume
If you'd like me to populate it for you:
1. Share your resume (PDF, Word, or text)
2. I'll extract all information
3. I'll update the portfolio with your actual data
